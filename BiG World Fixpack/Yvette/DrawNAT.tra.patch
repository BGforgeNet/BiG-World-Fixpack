Then the forest started to live again. I don't know if that gave freedom to the woman - I think yes. A moment later I woke up.~

I don't know. I will never forget it - the seagulls that called as they soared on the wind, the crashing waves on the cliffs... I saw the hero's face once - before <PRO_HESHE> fell asleep, <PRO_HESHE> wondered if it was time to leave.~
-@79   = ~At last <PRO_HESHE> left the citadel. I saw <PRO_HERHIM> weeks later, with several friends - a harsh but kindly elven woman, a bard who wanted to travel and learn more about the world, a mysterious elf who never told <PRO_HERHIM> their reason for joining the group... Only a few days later, they faced an evil creature - a wrathful spirit who wanted to rule the land as a tyrant. "You shall never prevail!" the hero taunted. The ensuing battle took two days, but the hero and <PRO_HISHER> companions at last defeated the creature. Then the spirit explained why it wanted to claim the land. Long ago, a past ruler of this land destroyed a temple dedicated to this spirit, slaying all who remembered its existence. The spirit wanted to avenge the fallen. After telling its story, the spirit died its final death, but that isn't the end of the story.~

 @80   = ~The hero built a new temple for the spirit and those who had died all those years ago. I joined them, because I thought it was a good idea. We built a tower with a huge monument inside. Then the spirit's last priest arrived, and he could hardly believe his eyes! He remained in the new temple, aiding the adventurers who required it. The temple's tragic past was forgotten, put aside in favor of its glorious future. It was then a place of happiness, and a symbol of how fate can change.~
