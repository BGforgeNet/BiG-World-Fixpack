 @1138 = ~(Dace is standing right in front of you suddenly, her face very close to yours.  She stares directly into your eyes for a long moment.  You open your mouth to speak but she quickly lifts a finger and places it on your lips, shaking her head, her expression very serious.  After staring at you intently for another few moments, she very slowly and deliberately crosses her eyes, wrinkles up her nose at you, and sticks out her tongue.)~
 @1139 = ~(Dace sidles over to you and kicks lightly at your shin, grinning crookedly.  For all that you've shared with each other, as close as you've become, and the feelings you know you both have, you still can't help being mildly apprehensive every time she spontaneously chooses to make you the object of her full attention.)~ [t#dac972]
 @1140 = ~(Frowning critically at your face, she deliberately lifts her thumb to her mouth and licks it, coating it with saliva.  Cupping your cheek in her other hand, she assaults your forehead with her thumb, rubbing vigorously.)~
-@1141 = ~Honestly, Ducky, I know we're travellin' a lot, but could you at least try and keep yourself lookin' presentable?  Downright embarrassing to be travelin' with a powerful demigod-sort-of-critter who can't even take the time to wash before slayin' dragons and rescuin' townsfolk.  They'll all be looking at the smudges on your face while they're talkin' to you if you're not careful... good thing you have me around, that's all I'm sayin'.~ [t#dac788] ~(Satisfied that she has erased the mark, she reaches out and wipes her triumphant thumb on your pants before grinning and wandering away.)~

 @1142 = ~(Dace reaches up and puts her arms around your neck, drawing you down into a kiss.  Parting her lips slightly as the kiss intensifies, she pushes one hand into your hair and moves the other along your side.  Increasing the hungry fervor of her lips and seeming to melt into you, she has done a fine enough job of distracting you, and you have been rather violently jabbed in your currently-unprotected sides before you can defend yourself.)~

 @1144 = ~Ducky... you are the most frustratin', tirin', confusin' creature I have ever, ever, ever met.  However, as a person who embodies all those traits m'self... well, I rather like you.~ [t#dac790]
