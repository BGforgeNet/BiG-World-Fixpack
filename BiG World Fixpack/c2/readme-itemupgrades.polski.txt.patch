+	* WeiDU update to v231
+Version 40: (updated by CamDawg)
+          * Items were run through the immunity effect batch fixes from the BG2 Fixpack since
+            most provided incomplete protections: Amulet of Ilmater, Tower of Iron Will, Citadel
+            Helmet, Improved Firecam Plate, Sword of Arvoreen, Shield of Harmony, Throwing Unicorn
+            Spear, Corthala Family Armor, Lilarcor, and Water's Talon
+          * Delryn Family Shield now casts PFNM directly so that it'll keep up with compatibility,
+            i.e. new projectiles from 1PP and elsewhere
+          * Azuredge copied over the same bug as the original Azuredge in that its 'Undead Destroyed'
+            message would never be seen due to effect misordering
+          * Closed exploit where Daystar, Azuredge and Skullcrusher's specific bonuses would apply 
+            to the other equipped weapon if dual-wielded. This also addresses a bug where these 
+            items would hurt the wielder when equipped if the BG2 Fixpack was installed
+          * Daystar's damage was incorrect vs. evil undead
+          * Blizzard Boots were using the Resist Fire/Cold portrait icon instead of Protection from
+            Cold
+          * Redundant AC bonus from Gloves of the Master Thief removed
+          * Quietus could cause blindness AND sleep on 1% of hits
+          * Elves and half-elves will now have their regular sleep/charm immunity from the 
+            upgraded items if BG2 Fixpack is installed
+          * Improved Kitthix's web and poison attacks had an incorrect duration
+          * Ring of Elemental Control now casts Improved Invisibility directly instead of simulating
+            it (compatibility); the charm effect is now limited to elementals
+          * The Ring of Wizardry and the Sorcerian Ring can no longer be worn concurrently (Wes had
+            coded this, but left a loophole open)
+          * Shield of Harmony had the wrong AC vs. missile attacks
+          * All of the upgraded spears had the wrong range, wrong attack animation mix, and were
+            doing pure piercing damage when thrown instead of the proper missile/piercing
+          * The charm animal ability of the Staff of the Woodlands was causing spurious save messages
+          * Power levels on the upgraded Celestial Fury are now correct
+          * Improved Human Flesh had a spurious move silently bonus
+          * The dispel-on-hit abilities of the Hallowed Redeemer and Unholy Reaver weren't fully
+            dispelling all effects
+          * The branches for the Shield of Harmony update (in the compatibility version of both
+            components) were reversed, preventing upgrades when you had all components and 
+            allowing them with only the shield
+          * All upgrades now account for the 'alternate' versions of items created by the P&P
+            Protection Items and Two-Handed Katana components of BG2 Tweaks
+          * All items now have relevant tooltip entries for their abilities
+          * The new magical armor and protection items can no longer be worn together
+          * The item icon for Teleomortis had a pink shadow when moved
+          * The Bag of Plenty icon was not transparent when in inventory
+          * The existing Quiver of Plenty now uses the restored icon found by Unfinished Business; 
+            the upgraded version now uses a variant of the restored icon
+          * Quiver of Plenty, Case of Plenty, and Bag of Plenty upgrades were allowing use
+            without non-proficiency penalties
+          * Quiver of Plenty and Case of Plenty now use the correct ground icons
+          * The Enchanced Robes of the Archmagi now provide magic resistance portrait icons
+          * The SoA and ToB components are now wholly independent
+          * Other minor fixes, such as a few items with incorrect weights or usability flags
+          * Minor description fixes, such as multiple THACO > THAC0 typos
+          * Future-proofed descriptions for BG2EE
+            Added by BWP Fixpack: (updated by Argent77)
+            * Character sets will now be converted as appropriate for EE games
+            * Added code to auto-format item descriptions to meet conventions for EE games if no 
+              separate EE-specific tra files were provided
+            * Added French translation - thanks to Sanctifer, of the d'Oghmatiques
+            * Polish EE-specific adjustments - thanks to Cahir
