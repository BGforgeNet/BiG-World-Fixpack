The Vecna readme states: "[...] the primary storyline is finished, fixed and will remain unchanged." This is a shame, because the story and its telling suck, frankly. 
This mod overhauls the majority of the original story with a more straight-forward, more lore-friendly, and far more grammatically correct story.
This is achieved purely by rewriting existing text:
 - Every punctuation-, spelling- and grammar error encountered has been fixed. 
 - Large portions of the original text have been paraphrased to be more concise and less repetitive, both in content and word choice. 
 - All techno-babble was replaced with more lore-friendly and less complicated magic-themed exposition. 
 - Referenced yet unecountered characters, like Android 11 through 18, and lore-unfriendly character-mentions like Thor and Anubis, have been omitted, seeing as they did not serve any purpose, except for cluttering up the narrative. 
 - Run-on-sentences and walls-of-text have been rewritten to be parsable by humans.
 - An attempt was made to keep the somewhat playful tone of the original text.

This is not really a mod in of itself. Instead it is a replacement for the installation files of the original mod. 
Simply replace the Language/English folder of the original with the one in this archive, before installing the main component.
It may be possible to include this work as a seperate language by carefully editing the tp2 file.
