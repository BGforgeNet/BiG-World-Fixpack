-@119=~Strangers! How bizzare, Well i must assume you are here with my patrons blessing so feel free to look round; i myself am searching for some reference material, do not mind me~
-@120=~What manner of creature are you that you wander freely here in this place of evil~
-@121=~Yes we are important emmisarries from a far land we to are looking for books~
-@122=~Well dont mind if i do! I am sure there is some interesting stuff on these shelves~
-@123=~Not so bizzare at all, well met stranger, what kind of material are you looking for ? A cloak , gloves ?~
-@124=~Hastur ?~
-@125=~I am of no importance to you, and from your manner of speaking im sure you are of no importance to me, so i bid you good day sir ! ~
-@126=~I doubt it! Your most proberbly thieves or spies, either way i think the plentifull guards here and in other rooms will soon see to your needs.~
-@127=~You obviously have little brain, and i have no time for creatures such as you~
-@128=~Yes, do i know you?~
-@129=~No but let me introduce myself my name is <CHARNAME> pleased to meet you~
-@130=~Well you are indeed a polite individual~
-@131=~I am to the genius that created 13 and 14~
-@132=~Thank you ! They were indeed the pinical of my work~
-@133=~And how do you feel about android 1?~
-@134=~That piece of junk my patron Lolth had me design ? I would have to say a definate departure from my normal work~
-@135=~Oh really how so?~
-@136=~Well given the history of 13 and 14 Lolth desired a more controllable and less "willfull" model line, she demanded less aggressive AI. This innevitably led to the useless 0 model, then she demanded minimal AI ! the result of which was model 1. it packs some punch on the battlefield but is easely defeated ~
-@137=~Sounds like it has a flaw ?~
-@138=~Indeed many~
-@139=~So you are thieves or spies, either way i think the plentifull guards here and in other rooms will soon see to your needs.~
-@140=~Would you care to elaborate on that~
-@141=~Well for a start model 1 is quite vunrable to energy weapons, and because of its low AI vunrable to psionic discharges~
-@146=~So we could destroy it with just a bolt of lightning, or maybe summon up a mindflayer?~
-@147=~Ha Ha HA...... Oh my you are funny.. No, im affraid nothing you could do would even scratch Android 1 ~
-@148=~So this conversation was a waste of time !~
-@149=~Really ? Maybe we are more powerfull than we appear!~
-@150=~Then the gods could help us.~
-@151=~There you go! it never takes long for savages to revert to their primal nature, good day to you !~
-@152=~Maybe you are, Maybe not ! I suggest you try !~
-@153=~Oh yes an avitar of a god, especially here in the astral plane, could do the job. But how exactly do you intend to get your god here ?~
-@154=~Hmm yes a problem.~
-@155=~Ok enough of this clever conversation and skirting round the subject we are both interested in~
-@156=~Indeed, anyway i tire of this dialog, good day to you~
-@157=~Hmmm Yes do go on~
-@158=~Just tell us how to defeat Android 1 and we will spare your miserable hide.~
-@159=~We want Android 1 dead and Lolths work terminated for our own reasons, you obviously want release from the hold the Bitch queen has on you, and equally you would like the perversions your work has turned to, erased~
-@160=~Spare me ! Ha you do not even have the means to follow me now as i teleport away !!!~
-@161=~Yes i do sense a certain power within you, got a little god blood flowing in there yes? Anyway as you say lets to the point, there is a way to attract the attention of a very special being one who can easily find this place astral map or no. If you have done your reading you will know her name, i for one dare not even think it for fear of drawing her gaze ( she bears me NO good will ). You will need to discharge a great deal of energy, that is the best way, she will come just out of curiosity. No spell will help you here, but there is a device that will do the job and at the same time mark Android 1 as her main point of interest, a very rare Travellers relic, i managed to translate the name ( in a crude manner ) as IMPLODING SINGULARITY PLASMA CANNON. Point it at Android 1 pull the trigger, if my research is correct it will create a beam of energy powerfull enough to cut a hole in Android 1 exo armor, the explosion will mark Android 1 for her attention.I will give it to you and with it you can defeat Android 1~
-@162=~Ok that sounds easy give me the err... rod?~
-@163=~Not so easy. Android 1 is only a small fraction of my work for Lolth, after the weaknesses of Android 1 became apparent to my patron she demanded a different approach something closer to the original model 13 and 14, an approach i seariously advised against since 13 and 14 were totally uncontrollable, and came very close to destroying reality as we know it. ~
-@164=~Plese tell me there is not an android 2!!~
-@165=~Affraid so, due to get out of his stasis tank within days i believe~
-@166=~So we use the same rod on him also ?~
-@167=~No the Travellers device only works once, you must get to to Android 2 before he emerges from the stasis chamber, before he germinates he is as vunrable as any infant in the womb, but to get to the chamber you will need all 3 parts of the wardstone key, and they are scattered around this complex heavely guarded and usually in locked containers whos keys are not known to me ~
-@168=~So i just have to wander around killing everything in my path? till i find a bunch of keys and these wardstones? Ok sounds good,and when i have the wardstones?~
-@169=~Take the assembled wardstone to the nexus ( the circular maze room ) find the only archway with no silver cord running from it, dimension door to it, then use the wardstone to gain accesss through the gate to the stassis chamber there you will most likly find most of hells legions rallied against you, and proberbly an astral Avatar of Loloth herself. You need to kill everything and everyone ( good luck with that ! ) then disengage the lifesupport that feeds Android 2, then hey presto your finished.~
-@170=~Ok hang on while i throw up .......... now you were saying something about facing Loloth and hells legions, yes about that point i started to feel sick~
-@171=~What did you expect! My patron is not totally stupid! So do we have a deal, the device for your word that you will finish the job ?~
-@172=~Yes go on then, always wanted to stuff a dryder down Lolths fat throat~
-@173=~Errr, no its just too difficult, i would stand no chance~
-@174=~Good attitude my boy, i am begining to like you, here is the Device, lets hope my patron does not end up making a meal of your soul, i will be watching to make sure you keep up you end of the bargain, oh and one last thing the guards in this room have almost certanly overheard our little chat, be sure to dispose of them for me, i would do it but now have other urgent matters to attend to~
-@175=~Then i will leave you to your wanderings, i would exit this complex immeadiatly if i were you, more guards will appear as your presence is noted increasingly, good day to you.~

+@119=~Strangers! How extraordinary! Well, I must assume you are here with my patron's blessing, so feel free to look around. I myself am searching for some reference material, so don't mind me...~
+@120=~What manner of creature are you, that you wander freely here, in this place of evil?~
+@121=~We are important emissaries from a far land. We, as well, are looking for books.~
+@122=~Well, don't mind if I do! I'm sure there is some interesting stuff on these shelves.~
+@123=~Not that extraordinary, really... Well met, stranger! What kind of material are you looking for? A cloak? Gloves perhaps?~
+@124=~Dr. Hastur?~
+@125=~I am of no importance to you and, from your manner of speaking, I'm sure you are of no importance to me. Good day, sir!~
+@126=~I doubt it! Most likely you are thieves or spies! No matter. I think the army of guards here and in the other rooms will soon see to you.~
+@127=~You are obviously lacking in wit, and I have no time for creatures such as you.~
+@128=~Yes, do I know you?~
+@129=~No, but let me introduce myself. My name is <CHARNAME>. Pleased to meet you.~
+@130=~Well, you are indeed a polite individual!~
+@131=~The genius that created the constructs.~
+@132=~Thank you! They are indeed the pinnacle of my work.~
+@133=~And how do you feel about Construct One?~
+@134=~Hmph! My patron Lolth had me design that one. I would have preferred a different route.~
+@135=~Oh, really? How so?~
+@136=~Well, the constructs are powered by the occult artifacts. But the artifacts have a will of their own, you see? Aspects of the dead god were transferred to the constructs. Now, which aspect is transferred depends on how much energy we decide to channel. Construct Zero received a minimal amount of the dead god's power, and thus its least developed aspect: Its compassion. That this was to be the case, I could not have known. What a failure. Construct One received much more energy, but still only a minor fraction--It received the dead god's sense of duty. It packs quite a punch, yet it is easily disabled.~
+@137=~It sounds like it has a flaw?~
+@138=~Indeed. Quite a fatal one, at that.~
+@139=~So, you are either thieves or spies! No matter. I think the army of guards here and in the other rooms will soon see to you.~
+@140=~Would you care to elaborate on that?~
+@141=~Well, Construct One is more susceptible to arcane energy than anticipated.~
+@146=~So we could destroy it with just a bolt of lightning?~
+@147=~Ha ha ha! Oh my, that's just droll! ...No, it has its flaws, but it's still a divine creature, at least partially. I'm afraid no mortal powers you could scrounge up would even scratch it.~
+@148=~So this entire conversation was a waste of time!~
+@149=~Really? Maybe we are more capable than we appear to be.~
+@150=~Then perhaps the gods could help us.~
+@151=~And here we are, right on cue! It never takes a savage long to revert to <HISHER> primal nature! Good day, <SIRMAAM>! ...I said "Good Day"!~
+@152=~Maybe you are. Maybe not. I suggest you try your luck, heh!~
+@153=~Oh, yes! A divinde avatar, especially here in the astral plane, could do the trick... But how exactly do you plan on summoning one here?~
+@154=~Hmm... That may prove problematic.~
+@155=~Enough of this useless chatter. Let's just stop skirting around the issue at hand and get to the point.~
+@156=~Indeed, I tire of this conversation. Good day to you!~
+@157=~Hmm... Go on.~
+@158=~Tell us how to defeat Construct One and we will spare your miserable hide.~
+@159=~We want Construct One destroyed and Lolth's plans foiled for our own reasons. Obviously, you want release from your servitude and to regain your scientific freedom.~
+@160=~Spare me! Oh please, spare me! ...Ha! Fool. You do not even have the means to follow me!~
+@161=~Yes, you do have a certain aura about you... Got a bit of divine blood flowing through those veins, do you? Let's get to the point, shall we? There is a certain elder being (I dare not speak Her name, lest I draw Her attention) whose curiosity may be sparked by releasing a sufficient amount of magical enery. I fear no amount of spells will suffice here. But I have 'aquired' from another planewaker a device that might do the trick. If you were to point and discharge this device at Construct One, it would, by my estimation, be powerful enough to pierce its armor and leave behind a strong arcane anchor, of sorts. Doing so would most likely draw Her towards Construct One. She might just finish the job for you. That is how you could destroy my creation.~
+@162=~Okay, that sounds simple enough. Give me the --err... rod?~
+@163=~It's not going to be quite that simple. Construct One is not my most recent design. After witnessing One's rather limited abilities, Lolth--bless her shrivelled heart--ordered the creation of a construct which harnessed all the remaining power from the occult artifacts. Naturally, I advised against this, seeing how it would certainly destroy us all--No compassion or sense of duty left to impart, remember? But there's no arguing with the Queen of Spiders, I'm afraid.~
+@164=~Plese tell me there isn't a Construct Two?!~
+@165=~Afraid so. I expect it to be finished in a few days' time. You must prevent that from happening at all costs.~
+@166=~Great. So can we use the same rod on it, too?~
+@167=~No, the device only works once. You must get to Construct Two before it is fully assembled and infused. Until then, it doesn't pose a threat. However, to enter Two's chambers you will need to assemble a wardstone from three fragments scattered throughout the complex. The fragments themselves will be locked away and heavily guarded, I suspect.~
+@168=~So I just have to wander around, killing everything in my path, until I find a bunch of keys and these wardstone fragments? Sounds... good. What do I do once I have the wardstone?~
+@169=~Take the assembled wardstone to the Nexus--that's the circular maze room. Find the only archway with no silver cord running from it, and teleport to it. There you can use the wardstone to gain access to Two's chambers. You will most likely be greeted by an infernal legion led by an avatar of Lolth herself. All you have to do is to kill them all and stop Two from being completed. Piece of cake, right?~
+@170=~...Did you just say I have to face an infernal legion led by Lolth? Are you serious, man?!~
+@171=~What did you expect? My patron is not stupid! So, do we have a deal? The device in exchange for your word that you will finish the job?~
+@172=~Fine. Give me the rod, then. I always wanted to stuff a drider down Lolth's fat throat!~
+@173=~No. I'ts just too much. I wouldn't stand a chance.~
+@174=~That's the spirit, <PRO_GIRLBOY>! I'm starting to like you. Here is the device. Let's hope my patron doesn't devour your soul, now. I will be watching to make sure you keep up your end of the bargain. Oh, and one last thing: The guards in this room have certainly overheard our little chat. Be a dear, and dispose of them for me, will you? I would do it myself, but sadly I have urgent matters to attend to.~
+@175=~Then I will leave you to your wanderings. I would exit this complex swiftly if I were you. Your presence will most certainly have been noted by now. Have a good day!~
