-@1=~Well by Thor, it?s about time you arrived here~
+@1=~Well, by Helm, it's about time you arrived here.~
 @3=~What?~
-@4=~Your treading on thin ice, and one step away from cold steel, explain yourself quickly~
-@5=~Urrrr.. Do I know you ?~
-@6=~No we have never met but your arrival here on this very spot has been foretold so I am here with a message ; Oh but where are my manners My name is Constantine~
-@7=~Hmmm Interesting say more~
-@8=~recently a seer named Abdul Azir ( The insane ) was sent a vision of the future from God or Gods unknown, this prophecy foretold the destruction of the Gods, ALL the gods, at a time not long from now~
+@4=~You are treading on thin ice. Explain yourself. And make it quick!~
+@5=~Uh... Do I know you?~
+@6=~No, we have never met. But your arrival here, on this very spot at this very moment, has been foretold. I am here with a message--Oh, but where are my manners? My name is Constantine.~
+@7=~Hmmm... Interesting. Tell me more.~
+@8=~Recently, a seer named Abdul Azir (the 'Insane') was granted a divine vision of a future yet to come. This prophesy foretold the destruction of the gods--ALL the gods--at a time not long from now.~
 @9=~Is this vision to be trusted?~
-@10=~Unfortunately Abdul Azir ( The insane ) has yet to be wrong in any of his predictions, the God or Gods that are his patrons seem to have knowledge of the future beyond that of Helm or even chronos himself~
-@11=~Surely Helm would not let this pass!~
-@12=~Helm has much to watch. Many are the threats that must be observed and countered, especially from the dark and chaotic powers in this imperfect universe. But even if he were to devote all his might to preventing this prophesy from coming to pass, it would be of no avail~
-@13=~why? Helm is a mighty god is he not?~
-@14=~Yes indeed, but the last part of Azirs prediction holds the sting, yes indeed, " The fate is sealed all the gods will pass at their own hand, yet I see one chance at redemption, a mortal with dark blood, raised in a candle, whose fire will burn through his worlds, you will find him in the Forgotten prime, on the world of farum, in the town of Athanka, where justice is made, at the date 15427.85385.978468.88 ( Multiverse time )"So as I said , your late ! its past 15427.85385.978472.00 already!~
-@15=~so let me get this straight, you need me to save the universe?~
-@16=~In a nutshell YES!~
-@17=~And if I were to agree what would be expected of me?~
-@18=~If you accept this solemn task you must gather information here in Anthanka to begin with, it is known that the twisted rune have vital information, they have a meeting spot nearby, in the bridge district, a door near the tanners shop is actually a portal, but be sure to have a Rouge Stone with you!.Alternatively seek answers in Hades some demons there can be squeezed for the truth.
-Yet the final battle will be on the Astral plane, that is known by all, hence I have been instructed to give you the means of travel to the Astral plane and a letter from Helm himself~
-@19=~Very well I accept~
-@20=~You dare threaten a messenger of the gods!~
-@21=~Errr since you put it that way NO!~
-@22=~Damn right! die you impolite scum!~
-@23=~Good, you have some wisdom, let us start again we have never met but your arrival here on this very spot has been foretold so I am here with a message ; Oh but where are my manners My name is Constantine~
-@24=~Attack me if you dare, but know you bend to the will of Helm despite this action~
-@25=~My name is unimportant, what do you want ?~
-@26=~I said it?s about time you arrived, hard of hearing ?~
+@10=~Unfortunately, Abdul Azir (the 'Insane') has yet to be wrong in any of his predictions. His divine patrons seem to have knowledge of the future beyond that of Helm or even Chronos himself.~
+@11=~Surely Helm would not let this come to pass!~
+@12=~Helm has so much to watch over already. Many are the threats that must be observed and countered, especially from the dark and chaotic powers in this imperfect universe. Even if he were to devote all his might to preventing this prophesy from coming true, it would be to no avail.~
+@13=~Why? Helm is a mighty deity, is he not?~
+@14=~Yes, of course. But the last part of Azir's prediction reveals a catch: "Our fate is sealed. All the gods shall perish by their own hands. Their meddling spells their doom. I see but one chance at redemption--A mortal with dark blood, raised in a library, whose fire will burn through <PRO_HISHER> world. You will find <PRO_HIMHER> on the prime material plane, on the world of Faerun, in the city of Athkatla, in a place of justice, at the date 15427.85385.978468.88 (Multiverse time)." So as I said, you're late! It's past 15427.85385.978472.00 already!~
+@15=~So let me get this straight... You need me to save the gods? Seriously?~
+@16=~In a nutshell? Yes!~
+@17=~And if I were to agree, what would be expected of me?~
+@18=~If you accept this solemn task you will have to investigate this wretched development. To begin with, it is known that the Twisted Rune, here in Athkatla, have vital information. They have a meeting spot nearby, in the Bridge District. A door near the Tanner's shop is actually a portal. Be sure to have a Rogue Stone with you! Alternatively, seek answers in the realm of Hades--some of the daemons there can be squeezed for the truth. However, the final conflict will take place on the Astral plane, this is known to us. Hence, I have been instructed to give you the means of travel to the Astral plane, and a letter from Helm himself.~
+@19=~Very well. I accept.~
+@20=~You dare threaten a messenger of the gods?!~
+@21=~Err... Since you put it that way... No!~
+@22=~Damn right! Perish, you impolite scoundrel!~
+@23=~Good, you do have some wisdom. Let us begin. Again, we have never met. But your arrival here, on this very spot at this very moment, has been foretold. I am here with a message--Oh, but where are my manners? My name is Constantine.~
+@24=~Attack me, if you dare! But know you shall submit to the will of Helm regardless!~
+@25=~My name is unimportant. What do you want?~
+@26=~I said: IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU ARRIVED! You hard of hearing?~
 @27=~You insolent pig!~
-@28=~That?s what I thought you said, care to venture an explanation?~
-@29=~Happy to! we have never met but your arrival here on this very spot has been foretold so I am here with a message ; Oh but where are my manners My name is Constantine~
-@30=~No sorry I am busy with personal business the universe will have to save itself~
-@31=~It is a pity you feel that way, but my duty is fulfilled your fate lies before you, look to the astral plane for all our sakes, I now take my leave, fare well child of Bhall~
-@32=~Good here are the ring and letter my duty is now fulfilled your fate lies before you, look to the astral plane for all our sakes, I now take my leave, fare well child of Bhall~
-@33=~SAVE THE UNIVERSE
-You have been given a letter from helm, a quest to stop LoLth from quite literally destroying all gods. Quite a quest! You have been instructed to find your way to the heart of the twisted rune either by finding their meeting place in the bridge district ( near the tanners house ) or taking a wander in Hades !~

+@29=~I'd be happy to! We have never met. But your arrival here, on this very spot at this very moment, has been foretold. I am here with a message--Oh, but where are my manners? My name is Constantine.~
+@30=~No, sorry. I am too busy with personal matters. The gods will have to save themselves.~
+@31=~It is truly a pity you feel that way, but my duty is fulfilled. Your fate lies before you. Look to the astral plane, for all our sakes! I shall take my leave. Fare thee well, Child of Bhaal.~

+@33=~Save the... gods?
+I have been given a letter from Helm. It details a task to stop Lolth from (quite literally) destroying all the gods. What a scoop! I have been instructed to find my way to the heart of the Twisted Rune, either by finding their meeting place in the Bridge District (near the Tanner's house) or taking a stroll through Hades!~
+@142=~Greetings, <CHARNAME>. Although always a pleasure, I am afraid you are a touch early. You see, we are not fated to meet in earnest until you have completed some more of your adventures in these lands. Please go about your business until some time has passed and you are a touch more (how to put it mildly) ...seasoned.~
+@143=~Sorry, still too early! Please return later.~
+@144=~Good. You have returned, and much more experienced, I see. Great! Let's get down to business.~
+@145=~We have never met. Mind telling me your name?~
